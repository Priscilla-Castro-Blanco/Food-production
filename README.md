# Worldwide Feed and Food Production

In today's world, we think we all have equal access to essential resources: internet, transportation, and food. However, accelerated population growth and the climate crisis are widening global inequalities, affecting access to these resources.

One of the most critical factors is the availability of food. Currently, agricultural production is divided between food for human and animal consumption. This database contains data regarding where these foods are produced and consumed, offering an opportunity to improve their distribution and efficiency.

In the face of future challenges, it is clear that the actual global food system is not prepared to sustain the growing demand projected for the next 25 years. Without significant changes, we risk a collapse in production, which could further deepen inequalities between nations and communities.

The data in this database describe the type of food (for human or animal consumption) produced in around 245 countries and territories.

In the columns, we can find the data of the place where the food is produced (the area and country), as well as its specific area code.

The other columns describe the type of food produced, and whether it is for animal or human consumption.
Finally, the data on food production from 1961 to 2013 are shown. 

### Questions to answer

I analyzed this data to answer the following questions:

- Which country(ies) consumes the largest amount of food in the world?

- Which country(ies) produces the largest amount of food in the world?

- Is more food produced for human consumption, or for animal consumption?
